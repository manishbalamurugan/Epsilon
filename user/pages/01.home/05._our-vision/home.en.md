> Learning is grand adventure, and like all great adventures, learning is something that is meant to not be done alone, but together. My journey in STEM began mainly in middle school where I was first introduced to a vast amount of oppurtunities for me to grow as both a scholar and as a person under the guidance of my amazing teachers. These experiences have given me a world of oppurtunities, and I believe that everyone should have an equal oppurtunity to explore STEM. In creating an environment where students of all ages can work together, I truly believe that we can create a community where learning is driven by the interests and passions of students who work and grow together as both scholars and people.
