        title: Mentoring
        description: "Stress has become a huge part of student life in the United States. This is due not only to the intense workloads that students receive, but also the constant change faced by students switching between grades, schools, and courses. The shift between elementary school to middle school or middle school to high school can be an especially tough time in a student’s learning career.  The tutors at Epsilon Academics are not only educators but also mentors. In addition to helping students feel more prepared for their academic lives, our tutors help them develop lifelong skills such as leadership, teamwork, and ambition to help them navigate the hardships of life. \r\n"

We specialize in mentoring and guiding students through exploring STEM subjects in Northern Virginia and the Washington Metropolitan area. From initiating and running club chapters to coaching for STEM-based competitions, we do our best to inspire STEM education within our community.

We tutor students who participate in several clubs at Lanier and we have also contributed to the development of two new STEM based clubs at Lanier.  We have mentored ESOL students in English Learners’ Academy, aspiring scientists in Science Olympiad, young mathematicians in Math Counts, budding engineers in 3D-Design Club, and ambitious innovators in STEM Club.  We believe that the implementation of this program at our public schools would significantly improve STEM education in FCPS and provide valuable learning experiences for students of all ages.
