Hi everyone!

Thank you so much for contributing your time and effort for Epsilon Academics.  This school year we have made huge progress:

* We have volunteered at Lanier for over 250 hours overall since our launch in November
* We have created a multi-school robotics team
* We hosted Fairfax High School’s first Major League Hacking Event
* We created Project Epsilon Club at Fairfax High School in order to recruit dedicated students to tutor
* We have helped manage English Learners’ Academy, Science Olympiad, 3D Design/Robotics Club at Lanier
* We revived Lanier’s MathCounts Team and helped them prepare for their competition at GMU
* We set up our own club, STEM Club, at Lanier as the first step in our community wide STEM Initiative
* We should all be proud of our accomplishments this year.  Thank you once again for helping us shape FCPS. We hope to see you all next school year.  We will also be running some programs over the summer so I will keep you all updated on that.


### Summer Plans
We are planning to help run STEM summer programs over at Lanier Middle School this summer!  The program is a great opportunity for students in FCPS to learn more about STEM and the possibilities where it can take you.  We hope to see you there! We will also be running Computer Science and CAD Design Programs later this summer so be on the look out for that.
